# jppinterpreter
Simple language, with basic types: int,bool, char, string,
with custom structures, arrays and pointers to variable.
Functions are first class citizens.
Functions can be recursive.
Variables are passed by copy, but it's posiible to pass
a pointer to variable (with C operators *,&).
Language constructs: if...else... while, for loops,
with continue and break statements.
IO with functions: print, readString, readInt.
Standard arythmetic comparisons, 
equality operator defined for all types, except functions.
